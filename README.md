# Introduce Me
A Foundry VTT module that lets you introduce NPCs or other actors with some flair.

The fanfare will display the actor's name, and optionally a short flavor text that the module adds to actors.
After the display, the actor will be set to display their name whenever someone hovers their token, since they have now been introduced!
